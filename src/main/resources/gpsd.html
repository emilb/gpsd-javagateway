Linux system, and want to read reports from it on TCP/IP port 2947, it
will normally suffice to do this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0
</pre><p>For the lowest-numbered serial port:</p><pre class="programlisting">
gpsd /dev/ttyS0
</pre><p>Change the device number as appropriate if you need to use a
different port. Command-line flags enable verbose logging, a control
port, and other optional extras but should not be needed for basic
operation; the one exception, on very badly designed hardware, might
be <code class="option">-b</code> (which see).</p><p>On Linux systems supporting udev, <span class="application">gpsd</span>
is normally started automatically when a USB plugin event fires (if it
is not already running) and is handed the name of the newly active 
device. In that case no invocation is required at all.</p><p>For your initial tests set your GPS hardware to speak NMEA, as
<span class="application">gpsd</span> is guaranteed to be able to process
that. If your GPS has a native or binary mode with better perfornance
that <span class="application">gpsd</span> knows how to speak,
<span class="application">gpsd</span> will autoconfigure that mode.</p><p>You can verify correct operation by first starting
<span class="application">gpsd</span> and then
<span class="application">xgps</span>, the X windows test client.</p><p>If you have problems, the GPSD project maintains a <a class="ulink" href="http://gpsd.berlios.de/faq.html" target="_top">FAQ</a> to assist
troubleshooting.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="DESCRIPTION"><a name="description"></a><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p><span class="application">gpsd</span> is a monitor daemon that collects
information from GPSes, differential-GPS radios, or AIS receivers
attached to the host machine.  Each GPS, DGPS radio, or AIS receiver
is expected to be direct-connected to the host via a USB or RS232C
serial device.  The serial device may be specified to
<span class="application">gpsd</span> at startup, or it may be set via a
command shipped down a local control socket (e.g. by a USB hotplug
script). Given a GPS device by either means,
<span class="application">gpsd</span> discovers the correct port speed and
protocol for it.</p><p><span class="application">gpsd</span> should be able to query any GPS
that speaks either the standard textual NMEA 0183 protocol, or the
(differing) extended NMEA dialects used by MKT-3301, iTrax, Motorola
OnCore, Sony CXD2951, and Ashtech/Thales devices.  It can also
interpret the binary protocols used by EverMore, Garmin, Navcom,
Rockwell/Zodiac, SiRF, Trimble, and uBlox ANTARIS devices. It can read
heading and attitude information from the Oceanserver 5000 orv TNT
Revolution digital compasses.</p><p>The GPS reporting formats supported by your instance of
<span class="application">gpsd</span> may differ depending on how it was
compiled; general-purpose versions support many, but it can be built
with protocol subsets down to a singleton for use in constrained
environments. For a list of the GPS protocols supported by your
instance, see the output of <span class="command"><strong>gpsd -l</strong></span></p><p><span class="application">gpsd</span> effectively hides the
differences among the GPS types it supports. It also knows about and
uses commands that tune these GPSes for lower latency. By using
<span class="application">gpsd</span> as an intermediary applications 
avoid contention for serial devices.</p><p><span class="application">gpsd</span> can use differential-GPS
corrections from a DGPS radio or over the net, from a ground station
running a DGPSIP server or a Ntrip broadcaster that reports RTCM-104
data; this will shrink position errors by roughly a factor of four.
When <span class="application">gpsd</span> opens a serial device emitting
RTCM-104, it automatically recognizes this and uses the device as a
correction source for all connected GPSes that accept RTCM corrections
(this is dependent on the type of the GPS; not all GPSes have the
firmware capability to accept RTCM correction packets). See 
<a class="xref" href="#accuracy" title="ACCURACY">the section called &#8220;ACCURACY&#8221;</a> and <a class="xref" href="#files" title="FILES">the section called &#8220;FILES&#8221;</a> for discussion.</p><p>Client applications will communicate with <span class="application">gpsd</span>
via a TCP/IP port, 2947 by default).  Both IPv4 and IPv6 connections
are supported and a client may connect via either.</p><p>The program accepts the following options:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">-F</span></dt><dd><p>Create a control socket for device addition and removal
commands.  You must specify a valid pathname on your local filesystem;
this will be created as a Unix-domain socket to which you can write
commands that edit the daemon's internal device list.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-S</span></dt><dd><p>Set TCP/IP port on which to listen for GPSD clients
(default is 2947).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-b</span></dt><dd><p>Broken-device-safety mode, otherwise known as read-only
mode. Some popular bluetooth and USB receivers lock up or become
totally inaccessible when probed or reconfigured. This switch prevents
gpsd from writing to a receiver.  This means that
<span class="application">gpsd</span> cannot configure the receiver for
optimal performance, but it also means that
<span class="application">gpsd</span> cannot break the receiver. A better
solution would be for Bluetooth to not be so fragile. A platform
independent method to identify serial-over-Bluetooth devices would
also be nice.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-G</span></dt><dd><p>This flag causes <span class="application">gpsd</span> to
listen on all addresses (INADDR_ANY) rather than just the loopback
(INADDR_LOOPBACK) address. For the sake of privacy and security, TPV
information is now private to the local machine until the user makes
an effort to expose this to the world.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-l</span></dt><dd><p>List all drivers compiled into this
<span class="application">gpsd</span> instance. The letters to the left of
each driver name are the <span class="application">gpsd</span> 
control commands supported by that driver.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-n</span></dt><dd><p>Don't wait for a client to connect before polling whatever GPS
is associated with it. Some RS232 GPSes wait in a standby mode
(drawing less power) when the host machine is not asserting DTR, and
some cellphone and handheld embedded GPSes have similar behaviors.
Accordingly, waiting for a watch request to open the device may save
battery power. (This capability is rare in consumer-grade devices and
nonexistent in USB GPSes which lack a DTR line.)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">-N</span></dt><dd><p>Don't daemonize; run in foreground.  Also suppresses
privilege-dropping.

Normally, a data source is the device pathname of a local device from
which the daemon may expect GPS data. But there are three other
special source types recognized, for a total of four:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Local serial or USB device</span></dt><dd><p>A normal Unix device name of a serial or USB device to which a
sensor is attached. Example:
<code class="filename">/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">TCP feed</span></dt><dd><p>A URI with the prefix "tcp://", followed by a hostname, a
colon, and a port number. The daemon will open a socket to the
indicated address and port and read data packets from it, which will 
be interpreted as though they had been issued by a serial device. Example:
<code class="filename">tcp://data.aishub.net:4006</code>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">UDP feed</span></dt><dd><p>A URI with the prefix "udp://", followed by a hostname, a
colon, and a port number. The daemon will open a socket listening for
UDP datagrams arriving on the indicated address and port, which will 
be interpreted as though they had been issued by a serial device. Example:
<code class="filename">udp://127.0.0.1:5000</code>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Ntrip caster</span></dt><dd><p>A URI with the prefix "ntrip://" followed by the name of an
Ntrip caster (Ntrip is a protocol for broadcasting differential-GPS
fixes over the net). For Ntrip services that require authentication, a
prefix of the form "username:password@" can be added before the name
of the Ntrip broadcaster.  For Ntrip service, you must specify which
stream to use; the stream is given in the form "/streamname". An
example DGPSIP URI could be "dgpsip://dgpsip.example.com" and a Ntrip
URI could be
"ntrip://foo:bar@ntrip.example.com:80/example-stream". Corrections
from the caster will be send to each attached GPS with the capability
to accept them.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">DGPSIP server</span></dt><dd><p>A URI with the prefix "dgpsip://" followed by a hostname, a
colon, and an optional colon-separated port number (defaulting to
2101). The daemon will handshake with the DGPSIP server and 
read RTCM2 correction data from it. Corrections
from the server will be set to each attached GPS with the capability
to accept them.Example:
<code class="filename">dgpsip://dgps.wsrcc.com:2101</code>.</p></dd></dl></div><p>(The "ais:://" source type supported in some older versions of
the daemon has been retired in favor of the more general
"tcp://".)</p><p>Internally, the daemon maintains a device pool holding the
pathnames of devices and remote servers known to the
daemon. Initially, this list is the list of device-name arguments
specified on the command line.  That list may be empty, in which case
the daemon will have no devices on its search list until they are
added by a control-socket command (see <a class="xref" href="#devices" title="GPS DEVICE MANAGEMENT">the section called &#8220;GPS DEVICE MANAGEMENT&#8221;</a> for
details on this).  Daemon startup will abort with an error if neither
any devices nor a control socket are specified.</p><p>When a device is activated (i.e. a client requests data from it),
gpsd attempts to execute a hook from
<code class="filename">/etc/gpsd/device-hook</code> with first command line argument
set to the pathname of the device and the second to
<code class="option">ACTIVATE</code>. On deactivatation it does the same passing
<code class="option">DEACTIVATE</code> for the second argument.</p><p>Clients communicate with the daemon via textual request and
responses. It is a bad idea for applications to speak the protocol
directly: rather, they should use the
<span class="application">libgps</span> client library and take appropriate
care to conditionalize their code on the major and minor protocol
version symbols.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="REQUEST/RESPONSE PROTOCOL"><a name="protocol"></a><h2>REQUEST/RESPONSE PROTOCOL</h2><p>The GPSD protocol is built on top of JSON, JaveScript
Object Notation. Use of this metaprotocol to pass structured
data between daemon and client avoids the non-extensibility
problems of the old protocol, and permits a richer set of record types
to be passed up to clients.</p><p>A request line is introduced by "?" and may include multiple
commands.  Commands begin with a command identifier, followed either
by a terminating ';' or by an equal sign "=" and a JSON object treated
as an argument.  Any ';' or newline indication (either LF or CR-LF)
after the end of a command is ignored. All request lines must be
composed of US-ASCII characters and may be no more than 80 characters
in length, exclusive of the trailing newline.</p><p>Responses are JSON objects all of which have a "class" attribute
the value of which is either the name of the invoking command 
or one of the strings "DEVICE" or "ERROR". Their length
limit is 1024 characters, including trailing newline.</p><p>The remainder of this section documents the core GPSD protocol.
Extensions are docomented in the following sections. The extensions 
may not be supported in your <span class="application">gpsd</span> instance

GPS devices (the "device pool").  If you specify devices on the
command line, the list is initialized with those pathnames; otherwise
the list starts empty.  Commands to add and remove GPS device paths
from the daemon's device list must be written to a local Unix-domain
socket which will be accessible only to programs running as root.
This control socket will be located wherever the -F option specifies
it.</p><p>A device may will also be dropped from the pool if GPSD gets a zero
length read from it. This  end-of-file condition indicates that the'
device has been disconnected.</p><p>When <span class="application">gpsd</span> is properly installed along
with hotplug notifier scripts feeding it device-add commands over the
control socket, <span class="application">gpsd</span> should require no
configuration or user action to find devices.</p><p>Sending SIGHUP to a running <span class="application">gpsd</span>
forces it to close all GPSes and all client connections.  It will then
attempt to reconnect to any GPSes on its device list and resume
listening for client connections.  This may be useful if your GPS
enters a wedged or confused state but can be soft-reset by pulling
down DTR.</p><p>To point <span class="application">gpsd</span> at a device that may be
a GPS, write to the control socket a plus sign ('+') followed by the
device name followed by LF or CR-LF.  Thus, to point the daemon at
<code class="filename">/dev/foo</code>. send "+/dev/foo\n".  To tell the daemon
that a device has been disconnected and is no longer available, send a
minus sign ('-') followed by the device name followed by LF or
CR-LF. Thus, to remove <code class="filename">/dev/foo</code> from the search
list. send "-/dev/foo\n".</p><p>To send a control string to a specified device, write to the
control socket a '!', followed by the device name, followed by '=',
followed by the control string.</p><p>To send a binary control string to a specified device, write to the
control socket a '&amp;', followed by the device name, followed by '=',
followed by the control string in paired hex digits.</p><p>Your client may await a response, which will be a line beginning
with either "OK" or "ERROR".  An ERROR reponse to an add command means
the device did not emit data recognizable as GPS packets; an ERROR
response to a remove command means the specified device was not in
<span class="application">gpsd</span>'s device pool. An ERROR response to a
! command means the daemon did not recognize the devicename
specified.</p><p>The control socket is intended for use by hotplug scripts and
other device-discovery services.  This control channel is separate
from the public <span class="application">gpsd</span> service port, and only
locally accessible, in order to prevent remote denial-of-service and
spoofing attacks.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="ACCURACY"><a name="accuracy"></a><h2>ACCURACY</h2><p>The base User Estimated Range Error (UERE) of GPSes is 8 meters

variability in ionospheric signal lag than latitude/longitude is, and is
also subject to errors in the estimation of local mean sea level; base

life-critical tasks such as landing an airplane.</p><p>These errors are intrinsic to the design and physics of the GPS
system.  <span class="application">gpsd</span> does its internal
computations at sufficient accuracy that it will add no measurable
position error of its own.</p><p>DGPS correction will reduce UERE by a factor of 4, provided you
are within about 100mi (160km) of a DGPS ground station from which you
are receiving corrections.</p><p>On a 4800bps connection, the time latency of fixes provided by
<span class="application">gpsd</span> will be one second or less 95% of the
time.  Most of this lag is due to the fact that GPSes normally emit
fixes once per second, thus expected latency is 0.5sec.  On the
personal-computer hardware available in 2005 and later, computation
lag induced by <span class="application">gpsd</span> will be negligible, on
the order of a millisecond.  Nevertheless, latency can introduce
significant errors for vehicles in motion; at 50km/h (31mi/h) of speed
over ground, 1 second of lag corresponds to 13.8 meters change in
position between updates.</p><p>The time reporting of the GPS system itself has an intrinsic
accuracy limit of 0.000,000,340 =
3.4×10<sup>-7</sup> seconds.  A more important
limit is the GPS tick rate.  While the one-per-second PPS pulses
emitted by serial GPS units are timed to the GPS system's intrinsic
accuracy limit,the satellites only emit navigation messages at
0.01-second intervals, and the timestamps in them only carry
0.01-second precision. Thus, the timestamps that
<span class="application">gpsd</span> reports in time/position/velocity
messages are normally accurate only to 1/100th of a second.</p><p>If your GPS uses a SiRF chipset at firmware level 231, reported
UTC time may be off by the difference between whatever default
leap-second offset has been compiled in and whatever leap-second
correction is currently applicable, from startup until complete
subframe information is received.  Firmware levels 232 and up don't
have this problem.  You may run <span class="application">gpsd</span> at
debug level 4 to see the chipset type and firmware revision
level.</p><p>There are exactly two circumstances under which
<span class="application">gpsd</span> relies on the host-system
clock:</p><p>GPS date reporting has a Y2K-like problem for which
<span class="application">gpsd</span> cannot fully compensate; GPS dates are
shipped as (week, second) pairs in which the week part is a 10 or
13-bit counter. When the counter rolls over, a GPS receiver may see
and report a date 1024 or 8192 weeks in the past.
<span class="application">gpsd</span> will detect and compensate for
rollovers while it is running, but relies on the system clock to
correct the epoch.</p><p>If you are using an NMEA-only GPS (that is, not using SiRF or
Garmin or Zodiac binary mode) and the GPS does not emit GPZDA at the
start of its update cycle (which most consumer-grade NMEA GPSes do
not) then <span class="application">gpsd</span> century part of the dates
<span class="application">gpsd</span> delivers will be wrong. Additionally,
near the century turnover, a range of dates as wide in seconds as the
accuracy of your system clock may be referred to the wrong
century.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="USE WITH NTP"><a name="ntp"></a><h2>USE WITH NTP</h2><p>gpsd can provide reference clock information to
<span class="application">ntpd</span>, to keep the system clock synchronized
to the time provided by the GPS receiver.  This facility is
only available when the daemon is started from root.  If you're going
to use <span class="application">gpsd</span> you probably want to run it
<code class="option">-n</code> mode so the clock will be updated even when no
clients are active.</p><p>Note that deriving time from messages received from the GPS is
not as accurate as you might expect.  Messages are often delayed in
the receiver and on the link by several hundred milliseconds, and this
delay is not constant.  On Linux, <span class="application">gpsd</span>
includes support for interpreting the PPS pulses emitted at the start
of every clock second on the carrier-detect lines of some serial
GPSes; this pulse can be used to update NTP at much higher accuracy
than message time provides.  You can determine whether your GPS emits
this pulse by running at -D 5 and watching for carrier-detect state
change messages in the logfile.</p><p>When <span class="application">gpsd</span> receives a sentence with a
timestamp, it packages the received timestamp with current local time
and sends it to a shared-memory segment with an ID known to
<span class="application">ntpd</span>, the network time synchronization
daemon.  If <span class="application">ntpd</span> has been properly
configured to receive this message, it will be used to correct the
system clock.</p><p>Here is a sample <code class="filename">ntp.conf</code> configuration
stanza telling <span class="application">ntpd</span> how to read the GPS
notfications:</p><pre class="programlisting">
server 127.127.28.0 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
fudge 127.127.28.0 time1 0.420 refid GPS

server 127.127.28.1 minpoll 4 maxpoll 4 prefer
fudge 127.127.28.1 refid GPS1
</pre><p>The magic pseudo-IP address 127.127.28.0 identifies unit 0 of
the <span class="application">ntpd</span> shared-memory driver; 127.127.28.1
identifies unit 1.  Unit 0 is used for message-decoded time and unit 1
for the (more accurate, when available) time derived from the PPS
synchronization pulse.  Splitting these notifications allows
<span class="application">ntpd</span> to use its normal heuristics to weight
them.</p><p>With this configuration, <span class="application">ntpd</span> will
read the timestamp posted by <span class="application">gpsd</span> every 16
seconds and send it to unit 0.  The number after the parameter time1
is an offset in seconds.  You can use it to adjust out some of the
fixed delays in the system.  0.035 is a good starting value for the
Garmin GPS-18/USB, 0.420 for the Garmin GPS-18/LVC.</p><p>After restarting ntpd, a line similar to the one below should
appear in the output of the command "ntpq -p" (after allowing a couple
of minutes):</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>When the value under "reach" remains zero, check that gpsd is
running; and some application is connected to it or the '-n' option was
used.  Make sure the receiver is locked on to at least one satellite,
and the receiver is in SiRF binary, Garmin binary or NMEA/PPS mode.  Plain
NMEA will also drive ntpd, but the accuracy as bad as one second.  When
the SHM(0) line does not appear at all, check the system logs for error
messages from ntpd.</p><p>When no other reference clocks appear in the NTP configuration,
the system clock will lock onto the GPS clock.  When you have previously
used <span class="application">ntpd</span>, and other reference clocks appear
in your configuration, there may be a fixed offset between the GPS clock
and other clocks.  The <span class="application">gpsd</span> developers would
like to receive information about the offsets observed by users for each
type of receiver.  Please send us the output of the "ntpq -p" command
and the make and type of receiver.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="USE WITH D-BUS"><a name="dbus"></a><h2>USE WITH D-BUS</h2><p>On operating systems that support D-BUS,
<span class="application">gpsd</span> can be built to broadcast GPS fixes to
D-BUS-aware applications.  As D-BUS is still at a pre-1.0 stage, we
will not attempt to document this interface here.  Read the
<span class="application">gpsd</span> source code to learn more.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="SECURITY AND PERMISSIONS ISSUES"><a name="security"></a><h2>SECURITY AND PERMISSIONS ISSUES</h2><p><span class="application">gpsd</span>, if given the -G flag, will
listen for connections from any reachable host, and then disclose the
current position.  Before using the -G flag, consider whether you
consider your computer's location to be sensitive data to be kept
private or something that you wish to publish.</p><p><span class="application">gpsd</span> must start up as root in order
to open the NTPD shared-memory segment, open its logfile, and create
its local control socket.  Before doing any processing of GPS data, it
tries to drop root privileges by setting its UID to "nobody" (or another
userid as set by configure) and its group ID to the group of the initial
GPS passed on the command line &#8212; or, if that device doesn't exist,
to the group of <code class="filename">/dev/ttyS0</code>.</p><p>Privilege-dropping is a hedge against the possibility that
carefully crafted data, either presented from a client socket or from
a subverted serial device posing as a GPS, could be used to induce
misbehavior in the internals of <span class="application">gpsd</span>.
It ensures that any such compromises cannot be used for privilege
elevation to root.</p><p>The assumption behind <span class="application">gpsd</span>'s
particular behavior is that all the tty devices to which a GPS might
be connected are owned by the same non-root group and allow group
read/write, though the group may vary because of distribution-specific
or local administrative practice.  If this assumption is false,
<span class="application">gpsd</span> may not be able to open GPS devices in
order to read them (such failures will be logged).</p><p>In order to fend off inadvertent denial-of-service attacks by
port scanners (not to mention deliberate ones),
<span class="application">gpsd</span> will time out inactive client
connections.  Before the client has issued a command that requests a
channel assignment, a short timeout (60 seconds) applies.  There is no
timeout for clients in watcher or raw modes; rather,
<span class="application">gpsd</span> drops these clients if they fail to
read data long enough for the outbound socket write buffer to fill.
Clients with an assigned device in polling mode are subject to a
longer timeout (15 minutes).</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="LIMITATIONS"><a name="limitations"></a><h2>LIMITATIONS</h2><p>If multiple NMEA talkers are feeding RMC, GLL, and GGA sentences
to the same serial device (possible with an RS422 adapter hooked up to
some marine-navigation systems), a 'TPV' response may mix an altitude
from one device's GGA with latitude/longitude from another's RMC/GLL
after the second sentence has arrived.</p><p><span class="application">gpsd</span> may change control settings on
your GPS (such as the emission frequency of various sentences or
packets) and not restore the original settings on exit.  This is a
result of inadequacies in NMEA and the vendor binary GPS protocols,
which often do not give clients any way to query the values of control
settings in order to be able to restore them later.</p><p>When using SiRF chips, the VDOP/TDOP/GDOP figures and associated
error estimates are computed by <span class="application">gpsd</span> rather
than reported by the chip.  The computation does not exactly match
what SiRF chips do internally, which includes some satellite weighting
using parameters <span class="application">gpsd</span> cannot see.</p><p>Autobauding on the Trimble GPSes can take as long as 5 seconds
if the device speed is not matched to the GPS speed.</p><p>Generation of position error estimates (eph, epv, epd, eps, epc)
from the incomplete data handed back by GPS reporting protocols
involves both a lot of mathematical black art and fragile
device-dependent assumptions.  This code has been bug-prone in tbe
past and problems may still lurk there.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="FILES"><a name="files"></a><h2>FILES</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">/dev/ttyS0</code></span></dt><dd><p>Prototype TTY device. After startup,
